## TicTacToe Game

This is a command line game.

Certainly! Let me explain the key components of the TicTacToe code:

### 1. Import Statements:
```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Random;
import java.util.Scanner;
```
These statements import necessary classes and interfaces for handling lists, arrays, random number generation, and user input.

### 2. Class Declaration:
```java
public class TicTacToe {
    // ... (rest of the code)
}
```
Defines the `TicTacToe` class, which contains the main logic for the Tic Tac Toe game.

### 3. Static ArrayLists:
```java
static ArrayList<Integer> playerPositions = new ArrayList<>();
static ArrayList<Integer> computerPositions = new ArrayList<>();
```
These ArrayLists store the positions occupied by the player and the computer on the Tic Tac Toe board.

### 4. Main Method:
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // ... (rest of the code)
}
```
This is the entry point of the program where the execution begins.

### 5. Game Board Initialization:
```java
char[][] board = {
    { ' ', '|', ' ', '|', ' ' },
    { '-', '+', '-', '+', '-' },
    { ' ', '|', ' ', '|', ' ' },
    { '-', '+', '-', '+', '-' },
    { ' ', '|', ' ', '|', ' ' }
};
```
Initializes the Tic Tac Toe board as a 2D array of characters.

### 6. Game Loop:
```java
while (true) {
    // ... (rest of the code)
}
```
This loop represents the continuous gameplay until there is a winner or a draw.

### 7. Player Input:
```java
Scanner scr = new Scanner(System.in);
int playerPos = getPlayerPos(scr);
```
Gets the player's input for the position on the board. The `getPlayerPos` method ensures valid input from the player.

### 8. Position Validation:
```java
while (playerPositions.contains(playerPos) || computerPositions.contains(playerPos)) {
    System.out.println("Position taken!");
    playerPos = getPlayerPos(scr);
}
```
Checks if the chosen position is already taken by either the player or the computer. If so, prompts the player to enter a new position.

### 9. Placing Position on the Board:
```java
placePosInBoard(board, playerPos, "player");
```
Updates the game board with the player's position and adds the position to the `playerPositions` ArrayList.

### 10. Winner Check:
```java
String result = checkWinner(board);
if (!result.isEmpty()) {
    System.out.println(result);
    break;
}
```
Checks if the player has won, if the computer has won, or if it's a draw. If any of these conditions are met, the game loop is terminated.

### 11. Computer's Turn:
```java
Random random = new Random();
int computerPos = getRandomComputerPos();
```
Generates a random position for the computer to play.

### 12. Computer Position Validation:
```java
while (playerPositions.contains(computerPos) || computerPositions.contains(computerPos)) {
    computerPos = getRandomComputerPos();
}
```
Ensures that the randomly generated position for the computer is not already taken.

### 13. Computer's Move:
```java
placePosInBoard(board, computerPos, "cpu");
```
Updates the game board with the computer's position and adds the position to the `computerPositions` ArrayList.

### 14. Printing the Board:
```java
printBoard(board);
```
Displays the updated game board after each turn.

### 15. Closing the Scanner:
```java
scr.close();
```
Closes the `Scanner` to prevent resource leaks.

### 16. Additional Methods:
- `getPlayerPos(Scanner scr)`: Takes care of obtaining a valid player position input.
- `getRandomComputerPos()`: Generates a random position for the computer.
- `printBoard(char[][] board)`: Displays the Tic Tac Toe board.
- `placePosInBoard(char[][] board, int pos, String user)`: Updates the board with the player's or computer's move.
- `checkWinner(char[][] board)`: Checks for a winner or a draw.

This should give you a comprehensive understanding of how the Tic Tac Toe game is implemented in this Java code.
